# AdventOfCode2021

This is my solution for Advent of Code 2021 challenge in TypeScript. You can find the challenge here: https://adventofcode.com/2021 :)

## Checking solutions

First you need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/download) on your computer. After cloning the repository, run `npm install` in the root folder.

As this project uses TypeScript, you have to compile the files to JavaScript with `npm run build` command. Then you can use `npm run start` to check my solutions :)
